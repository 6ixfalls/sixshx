# Six-ShareX Server
Simple ShareX server with uploading and sharing. S3 supported, the file host has to be hosted seperately; this only handles file uploads, embeds and redirects.

No support is provided; if you're looking to host this without experience, check out other projects on Github. All config variables are required. Copy `config.example.json` to `config.json`. Don't forget the Prisma `.env` config.
